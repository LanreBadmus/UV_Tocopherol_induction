# UV_Tocopherol_induction

Here we have determined UV-B induced accumulation of tocopherol in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana and asked 
1) whether induction relies on UV-B application duration (Kinetic study)
data and code of kinetic study is labelled as TocKS and Kinetic study_R respectively 

2) if UV (UVR8) or blue light (phototropins or cryptochrome) photoreceptors mediate accumulation of tocopherol (photomutant study) 
data and code of photomutant  study is labelled as PMSToc and Photomutantstudy_R respetively 
 
3) whether tocopherol contributes to UV-B photoprotection (VTE study). 

VTE study for carotenoids are labelled VteCar (data) and VTE-Carotenoid_R(code)
VTE study for chl a fluorescence are labelled VteChlFlu (data) and VTE-chlflu_R(code)
VTE study for tocopherols are labelled VteToc (data) and VTE-toc_R(code)

the data labelles Copy of UV intensities new setting 190121 shows the UV and PAR spectra and intensity measurement.
